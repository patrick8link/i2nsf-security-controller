      ConfD implements the Network Management Datastore Architecture
      (NMDA) defined in <a class="link" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8342.txt" target="_top"> RFC
      8342</a>.  A central concept in the NMDA is a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>datastore</em></span>.  A datastore is a conceptual
      entity where data can be stored and manipulated.  A
      <span class="emphasis"><em>configuration datastore</em></span> stores
      configuration data for the device, and the <span class="emphasis"><em>operational
      state datastore</em></span> contains all state data.
    </p><p>
      Each datastore has a <span class="emphasis"><em>datastore schema</em></span> which
      is the set of YANG modules supported for the datastore.  All
      data in the datastore must adhere to the datastore schema.
    </p><p>
      ConfD supports the mandatory datastores <code class="sgmltag-element">running</code>,
      <code class="sgmltag-element">intended</code>, and <code class="sgmltag-element">operational</code>, and the
      optional datastores <code class="sgmltag-element">startup</code> and <code class="sgmltag-element">candidate</code>.
    </p><p>
      The different datastores support a set of capabilities as
      explained below:
    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">running</span></dt><dd><p>
        The running datastore contains the complete current
        configuration of the device.
      </p><p>
        The schema for running is all config true nodes in all YANG
        modules.
      </p><p>
        The running datastore may include configuration that requires
        further transformations before it can be applied.
      </p><p>
        ConfD supports one such transformation, and that is support
        for <span class="emphasis"><em>inactive</em></span> nodes.  In running, a node
        can be marked as inactive.  This means that it is present in
        running, but not used by the system (which means that they are
        not present in the intended datastore (see below).
      </p><p>
        In ConfD, running can be configured to be in one of the modes
        <span class="emphasis"><em>read-write</em></span> or
        <span class="emphasis"><em>writable-through-candidate</em></span>.
        Writable-through-candidate means that running can only be
        modified by making changes to the candidate datastore (see
        below), and by committing these changes to the candidate.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">startup</span></dt><dd><p>
        The startup datastore is a persistent datastore which the
        device reads every time it reboots.  The contents of startup
        are copied into running when the device reboots.  The only way
        to modify startup is to copy running to startup.
      </p><p>
        The schema for startup is all config true nodes in all YANG
        modules.
      </p><p>
        If running is read-write and the device has a startup
        datastore, a manager can try changes by writing them to
        running. If things look good, the changes can be made
        persistent by copying them to startup. This ensures that
        the device uses the same configuration after reboot.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">candidate</span></dt><dd><p>
        The candidate datastore is used to hold configuration data
        that can be manipulated without impacting the current
        configuration. The candidate configuration is a full
        configuration data set that serves as a workspace for creating
        and manipulating configuration data.  Additions, deletions,
        and changes may be made to this data to construct the desired
        configuration.
      </p><p>
        The schema for candidate is all config true nodes in all YANG
        modules.
      </p><p>
        The candidate datastore can be committed, which means that
        the device's running configuration is replaced with the contents
        of the candidate datastore.
      </p><p>
        The candidate can be used in two different modes, with
        different characteristics:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          It can be modified without first taking a lock on
          the datastore. If it is modified outside a lock, it is
          marked as being <span class="emphasis"><em>dirty</em></span>. When the candidate is
          dirty it means that it is (potentially) different from
          the running configuration. When it is dirty, a lock
          cannot be taken. It leaves the dirty state by being
          committed to running, or by discarding all changes
          (which effectively resets it to the contents of
          running).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If the candidate is not dirty, and a lock is taken, no
          one but the owner of the lock can modify the
          database. If changes are made to the candidate while it
          is locked, and the owner unlocks it (or closes the CLI,
          Web UI or NETCONF session), all changes are discarded,
          and the datastore is unlocked.</p></li></ul></div><p>
        The candidate can be committed to running with a specified
        <span class="emphasis"><em>timeout</em></span>. In this case, running is set to the
        contents of the candidate. If a second commit, called a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>confirming-commit</em></span>, is given within the timeout,
        the changes are made permanent. If no confirming-commit is
        given within the timeout period, running is reverted to
        the state it had before the first commit.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">intended</span></dt><dd><p>
        The intended datastore is a read-only configuration datastore
        that holds the complete configuration that is intended to be
        used by the device.  It represents the configuration after all
        configuration transformations to running have been performed
        and is the configuration that the system attempts to apply.
      </p><p>
        The schema for intended is all config true nodes in all YANG
        modules.
      </p><p>
        In ConfD, intended has the same contents as running, but with
        all inactive nodes removed.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">operational</span></dt><dd><p>
        The operational state datastore is a read-only datastore that
        contains all operational state of the device.
      </p><p>
        The schema for operational is all config true and all config
        false nodes in all YANG modules.  It is possible to
        compile a YANG module to be present in operational, but not
        present in the configuration datastores.
      </p><p>
        Operational state data is typically not kept in a database but
        read at runtime by instrumentation functions.  This can for
        example be statistics such as counters and gauges.  In ConfD,
        operational state data that doesn't change very often can
        optionally be stored in CDB.
      </p><p>
        Configuration data in the operational state datastore have a property
        <span class="emphasis"><em>origin</em></span> that is used to inform the client
        where the data comes from, e.g., <span class="emphasis"><em>intended</em></span>
        if it was configured data, or <span class="emphasis"><em>learned</em></span> if
        it was learned via protocol interaction with some other system
        (such as DHCP).
      </p></dd></dl></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1044"></a>6.1.1.&nbsp;Datastore Example</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Suppose we have a very simple datamodel with a list of
        interfaces.  In running, we have configured eth0, eth1 and
        eth2, but eth2 is marked as being inactive.  There is no
        hardware present for eth1, which means it is not present in
        operational.  Further, the system automatically adds a
        loopback interface.

        A project using ConfD must choose a valid combination of
        datastores to support. Which combination to choose depends on
        the system resources available on the device, and which
        characteristics the end-product should have.
      </p><p>
        The following is a list of valid combinations:
      </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">running in read-write mode, no startup, no candidate</span></dt><dd><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              A single, non-volatile datastore is used.

              Once changes are written to the datastore, they are

              The application needs to react to changes to the

              startup is stored in non-volatile memory, and running in

              The application needs to be written in such a way
              that it reacts to changes to the database.  If CDB is

              Both running and candidate are stored in non-volatile

            RECOMMENDED.  When a manager reconfigures a node that has
            the candidate and also read-write running, the manager can
            never know that running is up to date with the candidate
            and must thus always (logically) copy running to the
            candidate prior to modifying the candidate.  This
            introduces unnecessary overhead, and makes automation more
            complicated.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              The application needs to react to changes to the

            without going through the candidate.  This means that a
            client that wishes to work with the candidate may need to
            copy running into the candidate, to ensure that no changes
            to running are lost when the candidate is committed.</p></li></ul></div></dd></dl></div><p>
        ConfD ensures that running and startup are always consistent,
        in the sense that the validation constraints defined in the
        data model hold. The candidate is allowed to be temporarily
        inconsistent, but if it is committed to running, it must be
        valid.
      </p><p>
        ConfD by default implements the datastores chosen in
        CDB. However, ConfD can also be configured to use an external
        database. If an external database is used, this database
        <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> implement the running and startup
        datastores if applicable. If the candidate is used, it may be
        implemented with CDB or as an external database.
