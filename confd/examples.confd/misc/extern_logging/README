Sending log data to external application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how to use an external application to filter
log data. The external logging functionality is intended as a
development feature.

This example use a python script to filter raw NETCONF trace data,
however, the feature is language agnostic and works by reading the log
data from standard input and then doing the required processing.


Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing

         $ make clean all start

  2. Run a NETCONF query getting the configuration that is
     filtered.

         $ make query

  3. Compare the real trace log with the filtered trace log and notice
     that the address tag content is replaced with ********:

         $ diff -u netconf.trace netconf_filtered.trace
