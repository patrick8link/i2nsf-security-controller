Loading crypto keys from an external application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how to use an external application to
configure the encryption keys used by the built in ConfD crypto types.

The application external_crypto_keys will read the encryption keys
from the file pointed to by the environment variable
CONFD_EXTERNAL_KEYS_ARGUMENT. CONFD_EXTERNAL_KEYS_ARGUMENT contains the
/confdConfig/encryptedStrings/externalKeys/commandArgument value from
confd.conf.

Try "make test" and follow what it does to get the idea. Then if you
want to experiment on your own you can:


    make all      - build everything

    make start    - start the confd daemon

    make load     - store some secrets in the database

    make query    - show database contents

    make stop     - stop the confd daemon


To create new configuration keys try

    rm -f confd.encryptedStrings
    make confd.encryptedStrings
