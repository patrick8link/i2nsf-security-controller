ConfD Example - NETCONF TRACE_ID
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This example demonstrates NETCONF TRACE-ID feature that introduces the trace-id
parameter into NETCONF responses, NETCONF logs, and traces.

Please note that the feature is enabled by setting the confd.conf parameter
/confdConfig/logs/traceId to true.

To run
------

1. Build:
    $ # One may stop any running ConfD daemon and clean the database if needed.
    $ make stop
    $ male clean
    $ make build

2. Start Confd and CDB Subscriber:
    $ make start
    $ make start-subs

3. In a second shell, output the NETCONF Trace Log for observation.

    $ make tail-netconf-trace

4. In a third shell, start a daemon to observe ConfD events.
   Notifications.

    $ make start-notifications

5. In order to trigger notifications and logging, edit some config.
   In a fourth shell:

    $ make edit-config

6. Now we can observe the NETCONF response with an added trace-id as an
   attribute to <rpc-reply> in the fourth shell and in the NETCONF Trace Log.

   Also see the corresponding Notifications Events received by the daemon  that
   is registered on ConfD Event Notifications which reflects the NETCONF logs.

   In the first shell one may observe the trace outputs from the CDB Subscriber
   application printing the call to MAAPI_NCS_GET_TRANS_PARAMS result and the
   trace-id that can be correlated to the NETCONF response in NETCONF logs and
   traces.

6. To stop the system:

    $ make stop
