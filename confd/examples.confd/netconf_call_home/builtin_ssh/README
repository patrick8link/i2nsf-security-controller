ConfD Example - NETCONF SSH Call Home
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates NETCONF SSH Call Home (RFC 8071) using the
builtin SSH server in ConfD.

NETCONF SSH Call Home means that the NETCONF server initiates the TCP
connection to the NETCONF client.  The client then initiates the SSH
session towards the server, as normal.  Even though the session was
initiated from the server (i.e., the device), it is up to the client
what to do with the session.

To run:
-------

1.  Build
    $ make all

2.  Start ConfD

    $ make start

3.  In a shell, start netconf-console, which will be our NETCONF client:

    $ netconf-console --listen --get

    netconf-console will by default listen to the standard call home
    port 4334.

4.  In another shell, instruct ConfD to call home to the client

    $ confd_cmd -c "netconf_ssh_call_home 127.0.0.1 4334"

    When ConfD calls home, netconf-console will run the "get" operation.
