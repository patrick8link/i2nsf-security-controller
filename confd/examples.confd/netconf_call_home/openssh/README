ConfD Example - NETCONF SSH Call Home
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates NETCONF SSH Call Home (RFC 8071) using an external
SSH daemon, in this case OpenSSH.

NETCONF SSH Call Home means that the NETCONF server initiates the TCP
connection to the NETCONF client.  The client then initiates the SSH
session towards the server, as normal.  Even though the session was
initiated from the server (i.e., the device), it is up to the client
what to do with the session.

To run:
-------

1.  Build:

    $ make all

2.  Make the netconf-call-home program owned by root and set uid on
    execution:

    $ sudo chown root netconf-call-home
    $ sudo chmod 755 netconf-call-home
    $ sudo chmod u+s netconf-call-home


3.  Start ConfD

    $ make start

4.  In a shell, start netconf-console, which will be our NETCONF client:

    $ netconf-console --user ${USER} --privKeyType rsa --privKeyFile sshkey \
                      --listen --get

    netconf-console will by default listen to the standard call home
    port 4334.

5.  In another shell, instruct ConfD to call home:

    $ confd_cmd -c "netconf_ssh_call_home 127.0.0.1 4334"

    When ConfD calls home, netconf-console will run the "get" operation.
