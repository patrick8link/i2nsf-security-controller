ConfD Example hooks in the data model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how you can define set-hooks and
transaction-hooks in the data model, how the hook callback is
implemented in Python.
In addition, the example also illustrates how to use Python MAAPI API
in the hook callback functions.


What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. defines data model of (ipv4) 'hosts' and 'hosts_ipv6'
2. when (ipv4) host 'ip' address and 'netmask' is configured (not committed),
   the set-hook automatically pre-fills gateway ('gw') address with
   smallest network IP address (according to the netmask).
3. when configuration is committed, the (ipv4) 'hosts' are iterated and
   corresponding 'hosts_ipv6' are created (if not yet exists).
   The IPv4 'ip' address and gateway ('gw') are converted to the IPv6
   (prefix ::ffff:: is used).
   After that, all 'hosts_ipv6' are iterated, and those not having (ipv4)
   'hosts' counterpart are deleted.


Source code
~~~~~~~~~~~

Description of class methods (see corresponding classes in the source code):

1. 'init_confd_daemon' - registration of hook callbacks
2. 'cb_init' - attaches maapi socket (used by hooks)
3. 'cb_finish' - last call detaches maapi socket (used by hooks)
4. 'cb_set_elem' - set-hook set_elem callback; calculates gateway address
   (from 'ip' and 'netmask') and configures it ('gw')
5. 'cb_remove` - set-hook remove callback; only logs message when
    called
6. 'cb_create' - set-hook create callback; not used in our scenario,
    it should not be called, warning is displayed
7. 'cb_write_all' - transaction hook write_all callback;
    called during commit, creates and deletes 'hosts_ipv6' elements according
    to the 'hosts' elements

Starting and running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing

        $ make all start

 2. Start the C-style CLI with 'make cli-c' in a different window and try some
    commands

config
hosts aa
ip 1.2.3.4
netmask 255.255.0.0
top
show configuration hosts
commit
do show running-config hosts
do show running-config hosts_ipv6

hosts bb
ip 5.6.7.8
commit
top
do show running-config hosts
do show running-config hosts_ipv6

no hosts aa
commit
do show running-config hosts
do show running-config hosts_ipv6

 3. Stop and clean

        $ make stop
        $ make clean
