ConfD Example: Push read-only data into CDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how you can instrument C applications to
push read-only data, typically statistics or operational information,
into the CDB operational datastore. To do this, the CDB API or
Management Agent API of ConfD is used.

What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "arpstat" application is monitoring the operating system ARP
tables by running '/sbin/arp -an' every 5s to get the current status.
Arpstat is using the Management Agent API (read-only), to create a
light weight transaction where a delete followed by a set_values()
operation is applied to the CDB operational datastore.

For Juniper CLI see line that begins with (J). Not available in ConfD Basic.
For Cisco XR CLI see line that begins with (C).

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing

        $ make all start

 2. The arpstat application will by default print out the application log
    at trace level. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail
    the log files. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

        $ tail -f ./confd.log -f ./audit.log -f ./devel.log -f ./app.log

    Note that you will only see log entries in the developer log if the
    operational data transaction result in any
    changes to the data.

 3. Try the cmd-*.xml commands in the example:

       netconf-console cmd-get-all.xml
       netconf-console cmd-get-arpstat.xml

 4. You can also compose the same queries using the CLI. Start the CLI
    with 'make cli' and try some commands

       (J) > show status arpentries

       (C) > show arpentries

    Remember to use <TAB> to speed up command entry. Since the data is
    read-only, there really isn't much more you can do here. Type
    'exit' to terminate the CLI.
