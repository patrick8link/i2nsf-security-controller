Data-provider with server-side filtering example in Python 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how simple server-side filtering can be implemented using
ConfD Python API. It uses the same data model and the same approach as the
introductory example #5 (examples.confd/intro/python/5-stats), but adds
server-side filtering capabilities.

The API in use is almost identical to what is used in the C example in
examples.confd/dp/filters; see the README file there for more details.
